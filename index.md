  Hi! My name's Henry, This website is my virtual CV and an overview of my projects. Thanks for visiting!
</p>

I'm currently based in Cambridge, England, finishing my PhD in Enhanced X-ray imaging and diagnostics with the department of Computer Science at Durham University.
This work has been carried out under the supervision of [Ioannis Ivrissimtzis](https://www.durham.ac.uk/staff/ioannis-ivrissimtzis/) and [Tobias Weinzeirl](https://www.durham.ac.uk/staff/tobias-weinzierl/)
You can read more about this work on my Research page.

## Education

**PhD Computer Science, Enhanced X-ray Diagnostics and Imaging**
*Durham University, October 2018 - Present*

* Part idustrially-sponsored PhD, developing novel algorithms for robust 3D reconstruction from single-shot, medical X-ray images.
* Facilitating X-ray enhancement via scatter removal, based on proprietory Monte Carlo simulations provided by sponsor organisation.
* Framing model reconstruction as classical optimization problem, regularized through domain knowledge.

**2:1 BSc (hons) Physics with Computer Science**
*University of Sheffield, October 2015 - July 2018*

* Overview of physics fundamentals, with a strong data-driven problem-solving focus.
* Modules included semiconductor physics, agent-based modelling, and data-driven computing.
* Two final year projects, developing an equation-based model for the spread of asymptomatic infections through university-scale populations, and developing a K-nearest-neighbour optical character recongition system, robust to high levels of noise in scanned pages.
